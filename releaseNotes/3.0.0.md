### Breaking
- Added support for folders.  
  The folder structure you have in the Enterspeed app is now reflected on your local disk when using the CLI. 
  Likewise, if you moved a schema to a folder on your local disk and call a `save` or `import` command the folder structure is updated in the app.  
  With the introduction of folders, the static `partials` folder is removed and the schema type is now part of the file name ([schemaAlias].[schemaType].[format]).  
  If you are already working with schemas on disk, you should clear the `schemas` folder and run a new `import` command to get the new folder and file structure.
